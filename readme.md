# latex-beamer like slides with revealjs and pandoc

You can make slides that look (moreless) like beamer, but as html files, so they can be seen in any browser, thanks to revealjs and pandoc.

Besides, by using markdown as a source, you can use a more efficient workflow.

Here you have a `beamer.css` file that tries to look similar to a beamer presentation. If you copy it to your `/reveal.js/css/theme/` directory, you can use it in your reveal slides.
